# 1-Machine-Learning
Everything you need to learn about ML is here!

Hello!
I hope you are having a good time, and you may be excited about Machine Learning.
This is my first repository which i will be uploading on github.
The folders are well organised so we don't need a content page, do we???

The repository contains code and datasets from various famous courses available online fully implemented by me.
Few of them are udemy, super data science and analytics vidhya etc.
I can't add much explanation to the codes but I am sure you will get through if you are smart enough.

If you need access to my project repositary, kindly contact me. I would be happy to work in collaboration.

So enjoy machine learning! All the best to you.
