Hello!

I hope you are having a good time, and you may be excited about Machine Learning.
This is my first repository which i will be uploading on github.
The folders are well organised so we don't need a content page, do we???

The repository contains code and datasets from various famous courses available online.
I can't add much explanation to the codes but I am sure you will get through if you are smart enough.

So enjoy machine learning! All the best to you.
